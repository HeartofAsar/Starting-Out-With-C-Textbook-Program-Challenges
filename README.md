# Starting-Out-With-C-Textbook-Program-Challenges
The Purpose of this repository is to document my development in programming.

It contains my solutions to the programming challenges found in the textbook. 

I am currently using Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE.

TextBook: Starting Out With C++ Structures to Objects (8th Edition) by Tony Gaddis.

This README will be updated with a list of programming challenges I've completed and the chapter they are found in.
